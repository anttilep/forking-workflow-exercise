# Veggi Tacos with protein

This is a modification of the original coderefinery taco recipe to include more protein.

- Roast cauliflower (optional)
- Smoked tofu
- Pickled chilis and vegetables
- Caramelized red onions
- Guacamole
- Yogurt
- Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan
- Pinto beans (necessary for each taco imo)
